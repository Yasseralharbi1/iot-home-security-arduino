IoT-based home security system using Arduino for real-time monitoring and intrusion detection.
IoT-Based Home Security System Using Arduino
Project Overview

This project presents an IoT-Based Home Security System designed using Arduino to enhance home safety and monitoring.

The system detects unauthorized access and environmental events using sensors, then sends real-time alerts to the user through IoT communication technologies.

System Features

Motion detection using PIR sensor

Door/Window intrusion detection

Real-time alerts via IoT platform

Remote monitoring and control

Low-cost and energy-efficient design
